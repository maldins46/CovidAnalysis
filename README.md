# CovidAnalysis
Python module used to extract relevant information from Italian Government Covid Open Data. The repository uses [Open Data from the Italian Government](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19) as a Git Submodule. As such, a plain clone does not initialize submodules. You have to clone the project this way:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/maldins46/CovidAnalysis.git 
```
Besides performing the clone, also recursively initialize submodules. Also, the submodule have to be updated manually periodically, by using

```
git submodule update --remote --recursive
```
